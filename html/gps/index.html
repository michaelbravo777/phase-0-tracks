What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

Semantic HTML allows you to define/label certain blocks of code.  This makes your code clear and helps the search engine.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser goes through your HTML and creates a DOM tree out of each HTML elemment.  Then it creates a CSSOM tree, then its renders the whole thing compbinging the DOM tree and the CSSOM tree.
