Release 2: Execute SQL Queries

sqlite> SELECT * FROM artists;
1|Boy George
2|Tears For Fears
3|Pet Shop Boys
4|Thompson Twins
5|Simple Minds

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> UPDATE artists SET name="Culture Club" WHERE name="Boy George";

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM songs, artists WHERE songs.artist_id = artists.id;

sqlite> SELECT songs.name, artists.name FROM songs JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.id;
