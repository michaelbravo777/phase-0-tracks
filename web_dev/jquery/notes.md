I usually learn by experimenting, so my plan is to just make a simple project and figure out what I need to research along the way.  I always start with something simple, try to get it to work.  Then I add more complexity.

I usually take brakes when I get frustrated or my brain starts to hurt.  Generally I spend 15 minutes watching TV or playing a game, then restart.

'Things didnt really go as planned.  It took me more than the two hours just to figure out how to use the hover.  So my plan for release 1 ended up being my release 2 also.  I'm not sure if I should rethink the way I tackled this since I've always learned by doing the thing.  I hardly absorb anything by just reading.  I suppose if I had to do this again I would just do tutorials, then the project.'
