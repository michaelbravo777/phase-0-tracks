I usually learn by experimenting, so my plan is to just make a simple project and figure out what I need to research along the way.  I always start with something simple, try to get it to work.  Then I add more complexity.

I usually take brakes when I get frustrated or my brain starts to hurt.  Generally I spend 15 minutes watching TV or playing a game, then restart.
