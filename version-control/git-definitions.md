# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is software that allows you to keep track of changes and rollback (if nessesary) to older versions.  It allows programmers to test changes without affecting the production version and allows a team to work separatley and seamlessly merge their changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master repo.  It copies the entire repo so you and your teammates can make changes without affecting the master repo until the changes are ready to be merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Commiting takes all your changes and makes a new "version" of whatever you are working on.  You would them be able to go back to theis version if you needed to.  A good commit message is a short, concise description of your changes.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when you and a teammate both change the same line in a file and try to merge your changes.
